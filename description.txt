Description
===========

	This program draws a 3-D robot that utilizes openGL lighting and texture mapping. Support is also included to move the camera around
	the 3D environment.

	Note:
		I have included the library stb_image.c, written by Sean Barret, from http://nothings.org/stb_image.c to help with the loading of image files into memory.
