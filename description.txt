CS 4204 - Project 2

Description
===========

	This program draws a 3-D robot that utilizes openGL lighting and texture mapping. Support is also included to move the camera around
	the 3D environment.

	Note:
		I have included the library stb_image.c, written by Sean Barret, from http://nothings.org/stb_image.c to help with the loading of image files into memory.
		
Instructions
============

	Turn Camera
		- Default state when program starts.
		- Press "p" to enter this state
		- Drag mouse left and right to make camera pan
	
	Zoom Camera
		- Press "z" to enter zoom state
		- Drag mouse up and down to make the camera zoom
	
	Rotate Camera
		- Press "r" to enter the rotate state
		- Drag mouse left and right to rotate the camera about the z axis
		
	Edit Limb Positions
		- Press "e" to enter this state
		- Right click the mouse to choose the limb to edit
		- Press 1,2,3 to determine the axis of rotation
			1: rotate the limb about the x-axis, default state
			2: rotate the limb about the y-axis
			3. rotate the limb about the z-axis
		- Drag the mouse left and right to change the rotation angle of the limb
	
	Save Current Pose
		- Right click the mouse and choose "Save Pose"
	
		
Program Execution Instructions
==============================

	Mac:
		make -f Makefile_osx
		./project2
	
	Linux:
		make
		./project2
		
	Arguments (optional):
		-s	A path to a file that will be created to store the current pose of the robot.
		-l	A path to a file that will be used to load a previously saved robot file
		
	Note:
		I have included a pose file called "ro.bit"
		

Completed Requirements
======================

	- Draw a floor
	- Create a 3D robot
	- Each body part has its own lighting material property
	- Each body part has its own texture 
	- Use mouse to pan, zoom, and rotate the camera
	- manipulate the body pose by using the mouse
	- saving the current pose of a robot to a file
	- loading a robot's pose into the program
	
Robot Pose File
===============

The format of the pose file is the following:

<String, name of the limb>\n
<String, path to the texture file of the limb>\n
<float, angle of rotation about the x-axis> <float, angle of rotation about the y-axis> <float, angle of rotation about the z-axis>\n
<float, R value for ambient lighting> <float, G value for ambient lighting> <float, B value for ambient lighting> <float, A value for ambient lighting>\n
<float, R value for diffuse lighting> <float, G value for diffuse lighting> <float, B value for diffuse lighting> <float, A value for diffuse lighting>\n
<float, R value for specular lighting> <float, G value for specular lighting> <float, B value for specular lighting> <float, A value for specular lighting>\n
<float, shininess value>\n
\n
